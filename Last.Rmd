This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# load libaries
library(caret);library(kernlab);library(ggplot2)
# read in data
data_train <- read.table("pml-training.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
data_unknown <- read.table("pml-testing.csv", sep= ",", header = TRUE)

# i choose to partition the data_train in a training set and a testing set for cross validation 
# of my Rnadom Forest model
set.seed(8484)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(data_train$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
# I remove the 1:7 variables in the data sets both training and testing because they are not related
# with the measurements or predictors I am interested to keep as predictors
training <- data_train[inTrain, 8:160]
testing <- data_train[-inTrain,8:160]

# I check dimensions in training and testing sets and homogeneity by the proportions of classes
# in each sets
dim(training);dim(testing)
prop.table(table(training$classe))
prop.table(table(testing$classe))
```


```{r}
# I chose a Random Forest model "rf" form caret package with classe as Outcome and all predictors
# with options prox and importance to get informations of predictors importance

modelFit_rf <- train(classe ~., data= training, method = "rf", prox= TRUE, importance=TRUE)
```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
